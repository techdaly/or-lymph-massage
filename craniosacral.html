          <h3>CranioSacral Therapy (CST)</h3>
          <p>CST is a light touch very relaxing massage-like treatment that focuses on gently releasing restrictions in connective tissues between the cranial bones, sacrum, and layers of protective lining or dural tube of the brain and spinal column. Restrictions in these structures have direct effect on the nerves exiting the spinal column via "sleeves" in the dural tube thus effecting organs and tissues throughout the body. This work is so effective, clients often report feeling very relaxed after a session and they often feel lighter and more optimistic the next day.</p>

          <p><em>
          …"CST was pioneered and developed by osteopathic physician John E. Upledger following extensive scientific studies from 1975 to 1983 at Michigan State University, where he served as a clinical researcher and Professor of Biomechanics.
          <br><br>
          CST is a gentle, hands-on method of evaluating and enhancing the functioning of a physiological body system called the craniosacral system - comprised of the membranes and cerebrospinal fluid that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord.
          <br><br>
          Using a soft touch generally no greater than 5 grams, or about the weight of a nickel, practitioners release restrictions in the craniosacral system to improve the functioning of the central nervous system.
          <br><br>
          By complementing the body's natural healing processes, CST is increasingly used as a preventive health measure for its ability to bolster resistance to disease, and is effective for a wide range of medical problems associated with pain and dysfunction, including:
