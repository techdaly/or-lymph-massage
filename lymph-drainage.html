          <h3>Manual Lymph Drainage Therapy</h3>
          <p>From the Klose Training website...<em>[Manual Lymph Drainage] is based on the techniques developed by Dr. Emil Vodder, Ph.D., MT. When skillfully applied, this therapeutic form of soft-tissue mobilization dramatically enhances lymph formation and promotes drainage within the superficial and deep systems of the lymph vascular network.</em></p>

          <p>As a certified therapist, I can</p>

            <em>
              <li>Develop appropriate treatment strategies for indications such as post-surgical edema, post-traumatic edema, fibromyalgia, general detoxification and other conditions.</li>
              <li>Competently perform MLD on clients after breast surgery for cancer (clients who are at risk of developing lymphedema).</li>
              <li>Competently perform MLD on clients with mild, medically-uncomplicated primary or secondary lymphedema.</li>

          <h3>Dr Chikly Lymph Drainage Therapy</h3>
            <br><br>
          The lymph system flows…unless it is restricted, congested or traumatized for a number of reasons. With the training I've received in both LDT and MLD, I can help the body waters to flow optimally thus cleanse, detoxify, boost immunity and nourish the body's systems and tissues. A Lymph Drainage (pronounced "dranage" like "massage") session is among the most relaxing treatments as it is light touch flowing work. Accessing the lymph system accesses the parasympathetic nervous system which is the "rest and digest" state and supports deep relaxation. Muscles, nerves and organs can be drained when they are stagnant, boggy and inflamed for some surprising outcomes. Draining the sciatic nerve and the quadratus lumborum muscle in the low back is often effective for pain relief.</p>
          <p><em>"…LDT is an original hands on method of lymphatic drainage developed by Bruno Chikly, MD, of France. Created out of his award-winning research on the lymphatic system, LDT takes traditional lymph drainage techniques and adds a level of precision consistent with recent scientific discoveries.
          <br><br>
          Using exacting anatomical science and distinctive manual processes, LDT enables practitioners to detect the specific rhythm, direction, depth and quality of the lymph flow anywhere in the body. From there they can use their hands to perform Manual Lymphatic Mapping (MLM) of the vessels to assess overall circulation and determine the best alternate pathways for draining body-fluid stagnations.
          <br><br>
          Therapists work with flat hands, using all the fingers to simulate gentle, specific wave-like movements. These subtle manual maneuvers activate lymph and interstitial fluid circulation as well as stimulate the functioning of the immune and parasympathetic nervous systems. It is shown that when these actions are accomplished, the results can be:

          <ul id="special-bullet"><em>
            <li>Reduction in edemas (swelling) and lymphedemas of various origins</li>
            <li>Detoxification of the body</li>
            <li>Regeneration of tissue, including burns, wounds and wrinkles</li>
